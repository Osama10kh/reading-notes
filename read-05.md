# Operators and Loops:
## comparison operators:
to evaluate a situation comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be.
* is equal to ==
  * use to compares two values 
* is not equal to !=
  * use to compares two values
* strict equal to ===
  * use to compares two values to check that both the data type and value are same.
* strict not equal to !==
  * use to compares two values to check that both the data type and value are same.
* greater than >
  * to check if the number on the lift is grater than the number on the right.
* less than <
  *  to check if the number on the lift is less than the number on the right.
**when we add "=" operator to ">" or "<" will checks if number on right equal the number on lift addition to greater than or less.**

# logical operators:
comparision operators return single values (true or false).
* logical AND &&
  * to test more than one condition. (if one of the conditions is false, return false)
* logical OR ||
  * test at least one condition. (if one of the expressions evaluates to true, return true  )  
* logical NOT !
  * this operator take a single boolian value and inverts it.

# loops:
loops check a condition if it returns true, then the code will run, then will check again if it still returns true, the code will run again, it repeats until condition return false.
## types of loops:
* For loop : to excute a set statements for each item, (run the code over and over again)
  * ex: for (var i = "number"; i "operator" ; increment or decreament) {};
* while loop : we use it when we don't know how many times we want to loop, if the condition is true (excute the statement), if the condition is false (the loop will breaking out).
  * ex: while (condition) {};
* do while: the same while but start the first block of code before the condition.

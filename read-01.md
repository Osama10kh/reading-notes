# Text editor:
The text editor is a software that allows you to write and manage text and you can use it on your web browser or install it on your machine, The text editor is very important and useful, and there are a lot of text editor with different features as, cod complement, syntax highlight and others features, these features will improve your typing for example, code complement and Emmet speed up your typing and save your time and syntax highlight can make your typing clearly, but they are all pretty similar, doesn’t matter who is the better text editor but what is really matter the text editor which truly that help you to make a complete web site successfully and you enjoy using the most, that is the really the best for you.  
But when you use a text editor that comes in your computer you should take this point into account:
To store your enter website save those files in the appropriate folders or sub-folders within the main website folder. Also save the files that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names.
Also, they don’t have useful features like code complement and syntax highlight, etc.
Third-party options software like Notepad++, Text wrangler, BB edit, Atom, Brackets, Sublime text and visual studio code they are widely used in web development.
Visual studio code is a free text editor has a lot of features already built in and has very healthy following in the web developing community.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a different software all coming together, text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger.
Command line:
A command line or terminal is a text-based interface to the system and that is similar to the Linux because both has a graphical user interface, so you can enter commands by typing them on keyboard and you will get the feedback similarly as text.
The shell is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running command for you, you can use echo command to know which shell you are using.
using the shortcuts in the terminal they make your life easier.
Basic navigation:
There are a lot of commands are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them
Like, pwd which stands for Print Working Directory and the command for this task is ls. It's short for lis, and the square brackets ( [ ] ) mean that those items are optional,
A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system. There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative, whenever we refer to a file or directory, we are using one of these paths. Whenever we refer to a file or directory, we can use either type of path, the root directory. It is denoted by a single slash ( / ). It has subdirectories
Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
Relative paths specify a location in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
blocks may use to help build paths.
(tilde): This is a shortcut for your home directory
(dot) - This is a reference to your current directory
(dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory
cd which stands for change directory and ls List the contents of a directories, etc.
about files:
everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file, As such it can sometimes be hard to know for certain what type of file a particular file is. Luckily there is a command called file which we can use to find this out.  
Also be aware of case sensitivity when dealing with command line options. For instance with the command. A common mistake is to see an option which is upper case but enter it as lower case and wonder why the output doesn't match your expectation. Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them.
 The first approach involves using quotes around the entire item. You may use either single or double quotes, anything inside quotes is considered a single item.
an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape the special meaning of the next character.
About hidden file You don't even need a special command or action to make a file hidden. Files and directories may be hidden for a variety of reasons. Configuration files for a particular user hidden for instance so that they don't get in the way of the user doing their everyday tasks.
To make a file or directory hidden all you need to do is create the file or directory with it's name beginning with a . or rename it to be as such. Likewise you may rename a hidden file to remove the . and it will become unhidden.

# Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

javascript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content,you can use javascript to select any element, attribute, text from html, and you can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
the html elements: opening tag, closing tag, attribute name and value.
the css elements: selector, decleration block, property name and value.
# what is a script and how do i creat a one:
a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal, to write a script you need to state your goal, list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
the script is like a new language the computer can understand and follow, and it contains vocabulary and syntax, so you have to learn to think like a computer to solve the probelms.
# designing the script:
the first step is detail your goals for the scripts, next break it into a series of tasks that have to be performed in order.
the flowcharts help you to work out how the tasks fit together, and show the paths between each step.

# Expressions & Operators:
an  expression evaluates into a sing value, there are two types of expressions:
1- expressions that just assign a value to a variable, like var (variable name) = value.
2- expressions that use two or more values to return a single value like, var (variable name) = value1 + value2.
expressions rely on things called Operators to allow a programmer to creat  asingle value from one or more values, types of operators:
* assignment Operators
* comparison Operators
* arithmetic Operators
  * +(add.)
  * -(sub.)
  * /(division) 
  * *(mult.)
  * ++(increment)
  * --(decreament)
  * %(mod.)
* logical Operators
* string Operators
  * there is just one string operator: + sympol it is used to join the strings on either side of it.

# Functions:
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task,If different parts of a script repeat the same
task, you can reuse the function.
to creat  afunction, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve it is tasks inside the curly braces (function declaration).
function elements: function keyword, function name, code block in curly braces.
# calling a function:
it is can done by one line of code (function name).
# declaring function that need information:
declaring done by give the function parameters inside the function, the parameters act like variables.
# calling function that need information:
when you call a function that has parameters you specify the values(arguments) it should use in parentheses that follow it is time and they can be provided as values or as variables.
# getting a single value out of a function:  
some functions return information to the code hat called them.

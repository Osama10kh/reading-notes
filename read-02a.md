# Markdown:
Markdown is a way to style text on the web, it is a regular tex with non-alphabbetic characters thrown like #,you can formatting words as bold, adding img, craeting list.
you can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
 * Gists
 * Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
 * Files with the .md or .markdown extension

 *examples:*
 * two stars (* text *) around the text make the text italic.
 * four stars (** text **) around the text make the text bold.


 ## Syntax guide:
 ```html
 * you can use headers from <h1> tag to <h6> tag to control the size of text.
 * ordered list: 1. text1
                 1. text2

 * unordered list: * text1
                   * text2

 * [link] (URL) this method to link any thing, and this ! [link] (URL) for the img.              

 * > for Blockquotes and `<>` for inline code.    

 *  use -[] to make task lists

 * You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

 * Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”.

 * Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~text~~) will appear crossed out. 

 * and you can add emoji like :smile:
```

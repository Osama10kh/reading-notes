# Lists
* Ordered Lists

```html
The ordered list is created with 
the <ol> element.
Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag 
and a closing </li> tag. (The listands for list item.)
```

* Unordered Lists

```html
The unordered list is created 
with the <ul> element.
```

* Definition Lists

```html
The definition list is created with 
the <dl> element and usually 
consists of a series of terms and 
their definitions.

<dt>
This is used to contain the term 
being defined (the definition 
term).

<dd>
This is used to contain the 
definition.
```

```html
* Nested Lists
You can put a second list inside 
an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list
```

# Boxes
## Box Dimensions (width, height)
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.The most popular ways to 
specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages.

## Limiting Width (min-width, max-width)
In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser 
window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates 
the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser 
window is wide.
## Limiting Height (min-height, max-height)
to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.
## Overflowing Content
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
* hidden :
  This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
* scroll :
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.  

## Border, Margin & Padding
* Border
   * The border separates the edge of one box from another.
* Margin
   * Margins sit outside the edge of the border.
* Padding
   * Padding is the space between the border of a box and    any content contained within it.    

## Border Width
The border-width property is used to control the width 
of a border.
## Border Style
You can control the style of a border using the border-style
property.
## Border Color
border-color
You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names 
## padding
The padding property allows you to specify how much space 
should appear between the content of an element and its 
border. 
## Margin
The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels.
## Centering Content
If you want to center a box on the page, you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.
## Change Inline/Block
The display property allows you to turn an inline element 
into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.
## Hiding Boxes
The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users 
but It leaves a space where the element would have been.
## Border Images
The border-image property applies an image to the border of 
any box. It takes a background image and slices it into nine 
pieces. 
## Rounded Corners
 the ability to create rounded corners on any box, using a property called border-radius. The value indicates the size of the radius in pixels.
 # ARRAYS 
 An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
## CREATING AN ARRAY
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable.
## VALU ES IN ARRAYS
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero.
# SWITCH STATEMENTS
starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

* var value(1) 
* switch (value) { 
* case '1': 
* msg= 'num1' ; 
* break; 
* case '2': 
* msg = 'num2' ; 
* break;  
* default : 
* msg = 'non'; 
* break; 
# SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES
Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa1se).

 # loops:
loops check a condition if it returns true, then the code will run, then will check again if it still returns true, the code will run again, it repeats until condition return false.
## types of loops:
* For loop : to excute a set statements for each item, (run the code over and over again)
  * ex: for (var i = "number"; i "operator" ; increment or decreament) {};
* while loop : we use it when we don't know how many times we want to loop, if the condition is true (excute the statement), if the condition is false (the loop will breaking out).
  * ex: while (condition) {};
* do while: the same while but start the first block of code before the condition.

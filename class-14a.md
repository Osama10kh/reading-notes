# Transforms

CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

## transform property comes in two different settings

- two-dimensional
- three-dimensional

## Transform Syntax

the including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

## 2D Transforms

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes

## 2D Scale

Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.

## 2D Translate

Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.

# Transitions & Animations

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

## Transitions

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.

## Transition Duration

The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property.

## Transition Delay

On top of declaring the transition property, duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property.

# Animations

used to building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes.

## Animation Duration, Timing Function, & Delay

Once you have declared the animation-name property on an element, animations behave similarly to transitions.
A timing function and delay can be declared using the animation-timing-function and animation-delay properties respectively.
